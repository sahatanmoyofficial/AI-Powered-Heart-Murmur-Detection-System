# 🫀 Heart Murmur Detection Using Audio Signals & Deep Learning

An end-to-end machine learning project that detects **heart murmurs from heart sound audio recordings** using **audio preprocessing, MFCC feature extraction, and an LSTM deep learning model**, deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Heart murmurs are abnormal sounds during a heartbeat that may indicate underlying heart conditions. Early detection is crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment.  
This project uses **audio signal processing and deep learning** to automatically classify heart sounds and assist in murmur detection.

The system covers the **complete ML lifecycle**:
- Data loading & preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Model training with imbalance handling
- Model deployment using Streamlit
- Cloud-based model hosting via Hugging Face

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. Load heart sound audio files  
2. Standardize sampling rate (22,050 Hz)  
3. Fix audio duration (10 seconds)  
4. Extract MFCC features  
5. Handle class imbalance using class weights  
6. Train LSTM model  
7. Evaluate model performance  
8. Upload trained model to Hugging Face Hub  
9. Deploy inference pipeline using Streamlit

## 📊 Handling Class Imbalance

The dataset is naturally imbalanced.  
Instead of oversampling or undersampling, **class weights** are used during training so that minority classes contribute more to the loss function.

This approach:
- Preserves original data  
- Reduces overfitting  
- Is suitable for medical datasets  

---

## 🌐 Web Application (Streamlit)

The Streamlit app allows users to:
- Upload heart sound audio files (`.wav` / `.mp3`)  
- Visualize the audio waveform  
- Run real-time murmur prediction  
- View model confidence scores  

The trained model is **loaded dynamically from Hugging Face Hub** for scalability and version control.
